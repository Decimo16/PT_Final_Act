# The primary purpose of this project is to develop a Point-of-Sale (POS) system specifically tailored for sari-sari stores. This system aims to address common operational challenges such as inventory management, price adjustments, and customer checkout processes. By providing an affordable, easy-to-use, and effective solution, the project seeks to enhance the overall efficiency of sari-sari store operations, ultimately contributing to increased profitability and customer satisfaction.

Sari-sari stores are small, community-based retail outlets that serve as a lifeline for many Filipino neighborhoods, offering basic necessities within walking distance. Despite their significance, these stores are often managed using manual processes due to financial constraints and limited access to modern tools.

In an increasingly competitive market, sari-sari store owners face challenges such as:

Keeping track of inventory levels amidst rapid sales cycles.
Responding quickly to changes in supplier costs with accurate pricing.
Maintaining accurate daily sales records.
Improving service speed and accuracy during customer transactions.

The lack of a streamlined, cost-effective, and intuitive system leaves many sari-sari store owners struggling to optimize their operations. By creating a customized POS system, this project aims to address these contextual challenges while respecting the unique dynamics of sari-sari stores.

This POS system is designed with the following core functionalities to directly address the identified problems:
Inventory Management:
Real-time tracking of stock levels.
Simplified input for restocking and updating product details.

Price Adjustment Tools:
Easy modification of product prices based on supplier costs.

Customer Checkout Features:
Automated calculation of total sales.
Options for cash or digital payment integration (if feasible).

User-Friendly Interface:
Simple design suited for store owners with minimal technical knowledge.
